Good questions to try

- Fraud
  
  - How many overlapping fraudsters did we find?
  - What is the risk correlation across datasets?
  - How does the overlap change if I set epsilon to 0.5 vs 2.0?

- Financial Inclusion
  
  - How many credit invisible customers can we help?
  - Which credit history bands contribute most to inclusion candidates?
  - What policy could increase inclusion in the top segment?

- Trading Risk
  
  - How many overlapping risky traders did we find?
  - Is there a relationship between trading frequency and portfolio value among overlaps?
  - Which thresholds make the overlap most significant?

- Overlaps and counts
- “How much overlap do we have?” or “Total overlapping entities”
- “Bank risky count” or “Insurer good payers count”

- Percentages and shares
- “What is the overlap share?” or “Overlap ratio”

- Accuracy and differences
- “What is the difference between private and true?”
- “How accurate are these numbers?”

- Privacy and identities
- “List the customer IDs” → returns a privacy-safe explanation

- Comparisons and guidance
- “Compare bank vs insurer” or “bank vs brokerage”
- “How to download Excel” or “Power BI export”
