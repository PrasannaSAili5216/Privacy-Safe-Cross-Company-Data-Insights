Here’s a clear, step‑by‑step guide to run the project and use the built‑in chat.

**Prerequisites**
- Windows with Python installed (accessed via the py launcher)
- Internet access to install dependencies

**Setup**
- Open a terminal in the project directory:
  - d:\Projects\Privacy-Safe Cross-Company Data Insights
- Install dependencies:

```powershell
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Start the Dashboard**
- Launch the Streamlit server:

```powershell
py -m streamlit run src/app.py --server.headless true
```

- Open the app:
  - Local URL: http://localhost:8501

**Use the Dashboard**
- Privacy Controls:
  - Use the sidebar slider “Privacy Budget (Epsilon)” to tune differential privacy.
  - Lower epsilon = more noise, higher privacy; higher epsilon = less noise, higher accuracy.

- Tabs:
  - Fraud Detection:
    - Click “Run Secure Fraud Analysis”
    - View metrics for Bank Risky, Insurer Risky, and Overlapping Fraudsters (noisy count)
  - Financial Inclusion (Credit Invisible):
    - Click “Run Financial Inclusion Analysis”
    - View metrics for Bank ‘Invisible’, Insurer Good Payers, and Potential Candidates (noisy count)

**Chat Interface**
- After running an analysis on either tab, use the section “Cortex AI Analyst”.
- Example questions:
  - “How many overlapping fraudsters did we find?”
  - “How many credit invisible customers can we help?”
  - “What is the risk correlation?”
- Notes:
  - The chat is simulated and answers based on the latest analysis results shown on screen.

**Run Tests**
- Unit tests to validate fraud and inclusion logic:

```powershell
py -m pytest
```

- Smoke test to confirm the server is reachable:

```powershell
py tests/smoke_test.py
```

**Troubleshooting**
- ImportError for modules (e.g., compute_inclusion_overlap):
  - Ensure the server is restarted after code changes:

```powershell
# Stop the running Streamlit process then start again
py -m streamlit run src/app.py --server.headless true
```

  - If you still see module import issues in some terminals, set PYTHONPATH for the session:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "D:\Projects\Privacy-Safe Cross-Company Data Insights"
py -m streamlit run src/app.py --server.headless true
```

- Data missing or outdated:
  - The app auto‑regenerates synthetic data if required (new columns like Credit_History_Months).
  - You can also regenerate manually by deleting the CSVs and restarting the app.
